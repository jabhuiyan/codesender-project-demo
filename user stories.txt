User stories:

1) Carson is a third year computer science student using python
to create a persistent Python interpreter on a webServer as a group project. Carson
has implemented a method that outputs the Pylint feedback for a given module below the
standard output of the interpreter. At the moment, the code is stored in a string variable
and not a module, which presented some difficulties in running Pylint on the actual given code.
His plan is to update this method so that the string contents are put into a new module
which can then be called by Pylint’s Run() method, which will display the feedback on the
provided code, rather than the codeServer module itself (which was essentially a stub implementation). This method can also be further decoupled by moving it’s methods into it’s
own module.


2) Aneesh is a Final year computer science student who is creating a persistent Python interpreter on a webserver with his teammates. 
Aneesh is working on the persistence storage of the program where the code entered in the intrepreter will be stored persistently
and can be seen on the webserver when the user opens it the next time. He has implemented a module called util to be able to do this.
At present, the persistence only saves the last ran code but he is looking to have all the codes ran by the user saved for easy access. 
He is trying to implement this by creating user/password page in the webserver so that all codes ran by an user can be retreived.


3) Jubaer is trying to learn some basic data science works in the summer vacation. He hears numpy is a good library to get started with. He wants to
practice using numpy as a beginner in the codeServer. There are some beginner level questions he can choose from should he feel the need to test himself
while practicing.
